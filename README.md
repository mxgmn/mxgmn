I start a PhD in Computer Science at [Brown](https://visual.cs.brown.edu/) this fall.

Currently, I work with language models and on visual programming at [HypeHype](https://hypehype.com/).

My research is sponsored by [Embark Studios](https://www.embark-studios.com/) and [my GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/mxgmn).
